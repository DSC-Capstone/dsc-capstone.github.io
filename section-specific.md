# Accessing section-specific data

Some mentors have coordinated with the methodology staff and DSMLP to provide **only** the students in their section access to data on DSMLP. This data lives in section-specific folders that only the students in their section have access to.

Here's how to launch a server on DSMLP in a way that you can access this section-specific data. For the purposes of this example, we will assume you want to use the vanilla `launch-scipy-ml.sh` launch script, but these steps work with any launch script and flags. Also, note that here "team" and "section" mean the same thing; by "team" we don't mean your project's team.

1. `ssh` onto DSMLP as usual. Don't run any launch scripts yet.
2. Run `launch-scipy-ml.sh -W DSC180A_FA22_A00 -G list`. Note that this won't actually launch a server â€“ instead, this will list all of the groups you are a part of. You should see a row that contains your capstone section number for the "Team," like `DSC 180A - A14 [88137]` in the example below. **Copy the "Team ID"** (`dsc180aa1488137100014352` in the example below).

**Note:** If you don't see the right team information at this step, contact Suraj.

3. Run `launch-scipy-ml.sh -W DSC180A_FA22_A00 -G <teamid>`, with `<teamid>` replaced with the Team ID you copied earlier. If you're in section A14 like in the example above, you'd run `launch-scipy-ml.sh -W DSC180A_FA22_A00 -G dsc180aa1488137100014352`.

4. After your server launches, run `ls`. You should see three folders â€“ `private`, `public`, and `teams`. Your home directory is in `private` (that's where all your code should live). The `public` folder contains files that the methodology course staff may share with the entire course. 

5. To find your section-specific data, `cd` into `teams`. Run `ls` to see a list of all of the teams in the course and identify the name of yours. This may look like the example below. If, again, you're in section A14, your team-specific folder is `"dsc-180a---a14-[88137]"` (the quotes are important). If you `cd` into that folder, you'll see the files that your mentor uploaded for you!

All you need to do now is access the data in your team's folder from your code in the `private` folder! For instance, from a script at the root of your `private` folder, a path to a file in your team's folder might be `"../teams/dsc-180a---a14-[88137]/example.txt"`.
