Hey! I'm Praveen, from Fremont, California, and I'm currently a master's student in computer science here at UCSD. I just graduated this past year from UCSD's data science program, so I've been down this road before, and I know how challenging but also exciting this capstone can be. I can't wait to see how everyone's projects develop over the next year, and I'm here to help however I can with that process! In my free time, I watch a lot of sports, read books from Geisel, and struggle to play the guitar.
