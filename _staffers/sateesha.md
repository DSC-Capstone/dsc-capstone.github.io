Hey everyone! I grew up in Mysuru, India and completed my undergrad studies there. I am a CS grad student and I have done numerous data science projects in my undergrad. I am excited to be a TA for DSC180A and eager to explore the new ways I can help you all around. I love meeting new people and I am always up for a chat. So, feel free to say hi if you see me anywhere :) Outside of the class, I am either trying a new recipe, reading a novel or watching a series. Excited to work with you all!
