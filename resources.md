    - To view the amount of disk space you have left, navigate [here](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/spawn). At the `/hub/spawn` page, select the Services Tab > "disk-quota-service".
    - Use `launch-scipy-ml.sh -h` to see all launch options.
    - By default, you can only request 1 GPU (with `-g 1`). To request more, in addition to using `-g n` (where `n` is some integer between `2` and `8`), use `-p low` to specify that your request is _low priority_. For instance, `launch-scipy-ml.sh -g 4 -p low`.
    - Visit [here](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/status) to see which pods and GPUs are currently free.
