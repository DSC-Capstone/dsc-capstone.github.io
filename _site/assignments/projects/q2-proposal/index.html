the place of Methodology Lesson 7. You should read it before you complete <a href="../../methodology/q1/04">Methodology Assignment 4</a>, due on Sunday, November 13th.</em></p><p>As you know, your main deliverable throughout the capstone sequence is your Quarter 2 Project. In order to ensure that you’ll be able to successfully execute your project, you’re required to submit a detailed proposal.</p><p>The proposal consists of three parts. The proposal is worth 15% of your DSC 180A grade; each component of the proposal is worth the same amount (5% of your DSC 180A grade). Below, we describe each component and its deliverables in more detail. <strong>All components are due on Monday, December 5th at 11:59PM to Gradescope.</strong></p><h3 class="no_toc" id="groups"> <a href="#groups" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="groups"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Groups</h3><p>Quarter 2 Projects <strong>must</strong> be worked on in groups of 2-4. You must submit your proposal with the same group that you’ll work on the project with. It is up to your mentor to determine how groups are formed; you should ask them <em>how</em> groups will be formed soon.</p><h3 class="no_toc" id="context"> <a href="#context" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="context"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Context</h3><p>After this year, whether you work in industry or academia, you will often have to write project proposals.</p><ul><li>As a data scientist in industry, you’ll often have to write proposals to justify why your idea has value and is worth investigating.<li>In academia, to receive any sort of funding, you’ll need to write a grant proposal, which reads similarly to a project proposal.</ul><p>As such, you are required to write a project proposal here, not just to better plan your Quarter 2 Project, but to gain this valuable skill. You must write a proposal even if your mentor has already determined what your Quarter 2 Project is going to be.</p><hr /><ol id="markdown-toc"><li><a href="#written-proposal" id="markdown-toc-written-proposal">Written Proposal</a><ol><li><a href="#description" id="markdown-toc-description">Description</a><li><a href="#working-in-groups" id="markdown-toc-working-in-groups">Working in Groups</a><li><a href="#ideation" id="markdown-toc-ideation">Ideation</a><li><a href="#deliverables-and-grading" id="markdown-toc-deliverables-and-grading">Deliverables and Grading</a></ol><li><a href="#schedule" id="markdown-toc-schedule">Schedule</a><ol><li><a href="#description-1" id="markdown-toc-description-1">Description</a><li><a href="#frequently-asked-questions" id="markdown-toc-frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a><li><a href="#deliverables-and-grading-1" id="markdown-toc-deliverables-and-grading-1">Deliverables and Grading</a></ol><li><a href="#elevator-pitch" id="markdown-toc-elevator-pitch">Elevator Pitch</a><ol><li><a href="#description-2" id="markdown-toc-description-2">Description</a><li><a href="#tips" id="markdown-toc-tips">Tips</a><li><a href="#deliverables-and-grading-2" id="markdown-toc-deliverables-and-grading-2">Deliverables and Grading</a></ol></ol><hr /><h2 id="written-proposal"> <a href="#written-proposal" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="written-proposal"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Written Proposal</h2><h3 id="description"> <a href="#description" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="description"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Description</h3><p>The most important component of your proposal submission is a written proposal. Your written proposal should:</p><ul><li>State the problem being investigated, for both a general audience who knows nothing about your domain and a domain expert (like your mentor).<li>Give the reader enough context to convince them the problem is interesting and worth investigating – if the project is executed, what will its impact be?<li>Provide enough detail for a domain expert to understand whether the project’s goals are realistic to complete using the methods described and in the timeframe allocated.<li>Specify the project’s primary output, e.g. a report/paper, a website, or an application. (Note that even if your primary output is a website, you will still have to write a paper, and vice versa.)</ul><p>Like the <a href="../../../lessons/q1/03#introduction">Introduction</a> section of a paper, a written proposal should consist of three parts, that start broad and get increasingly narrower. (In fact, you will reuse a lot of your written proposal when writing your Quarter 2 Project’s introduction section.) Specifically, your written proposal should have three sections:</p><ol><li><p>A broad problem statement, with context to justify the investment in spending 10 weeks on the project. This should be accessible to anyone – for instance, methodology staff, your family and friends, and hiring managers for the jobs you apply to should all be able to read this and understand what you are proposing and why it matters.</p><li><p>A narrow, careful problem statement for the domain expert. This section should discuss how these problems relate to the Quarter 1 Project in your domain. Has previous work attempted to answer these specific problems? If so, how did they fail? If not, why are these problems interesting? In what way does your investigation address a deficiency in the Quarter 1 Project? This section should be quite technical – make sure to refer to specific methods.</p><li><p>A statement of the primary output (i.e., state whether you will create a report/paper, a website, or an application). If your project <em>analyzes</em> data, specify how you will communicate the analyses. If your project <em>generates</em> data, how will you analyze the data it produces?</p></ol><p>In addition to the above structure, you need to justify why your project will be successful. In particular, if your project relies on data that was <em>not</em> used in the Quarter 1 Project, you need to prove the following:</p><ol><li>You can obtain the data.<li>The data contains the information needed.<li>The data is of sufficient quality.</ol><p>The easiest way to do this is to actually obtain the data while writing the proposal and perform some preliminary analyses to ensure it will actually be able to help you accomplish your goals. In years past, many groups fell in the trap of waiting until Quarter 2 to obtain their data, and by the time they realized that they either can’t obtain their data or that it won’t actually help them with their project, they had wasted a significant portion of the quarter. <strong>Don’t let this be you!</strong></p><h3 id="working-in-groups"> <a href="#working-in-groups" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="working-in-groups"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Working in Groups</h3><p><strong>Your proposal will form a contract for what you will work on in Quarter 2.</strong> You will have to work together and make decisions as a group, even if you may not fully agree with the choices. As you develop your proposal, consider the following:</p><ul><li>Try to agree on a general <em>theme</em> for what you want to investigate in your project.<li>You do <em>not</em> need to have 100% agreement on the proposal, rather you need to be sure that the proposed area of investigation is interesting to you. The specifics of a proposal change as you work on it, and you may have to change direction while working on the project itself anyway.<li>Discuss how your strengths might complement a teammate’s strengths. A proposal can consist of semi-independent pieces that fit individual team-member’s strengths – for instance, one student can be responsible for building and designing an ML model, another can be responsible for a statistical investigation into the data generated by the ML model, and another can be responsible for developing custom visualizations of the results. All of these would be too much for a single person to do well in a quarter, but they are all achievable when working in a group.</ul><h3 id="ideation"> <a href="#ideation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="ideation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Ideation</h3><p>As of the release of this assignment (Week 7), you may not be sure <em>what</em> to propose for Quarter 2. That’s totally fine. To help you get started, <a href="../../methodology/q1/04">Methodology Assignment 4</a> will have you brainstorm ideas based on your current understanding of your domain. Your mentor will use your answers to encourage discussions about possible projects in Week 8.</p><p>Note that the amount of freedom you have in proposing your own project will depend on your mentor. In fact, your mentor may already have determined what your Quarter 2 Project will be, and that’s fine. In any case, your mentor will play a crucial role in your proposal, as they’ll be able to help you come up with a plan that you can realistically execute in 10 weeks under their guidance. Your final proposal submission should not surprise them at any point, because you should be discussing it with them regularly and incorporating their feedback.</p><p>It’s also a good idea to look at the <a href="https://dsc-capstone.github.io/archive/">Archive</a> to see what students were able to accomplish in Quarter 2 in years past.</p><h3 id="deliverables-and-grading"> <a href="#deliverables-and-grading" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="deliverables-and-grading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Deliverables and Grading</h3><p>You’ll submit your written proposal as a PDF to Gradescope <strong>as a group</strong>. Your mentor will grade it according to <a href="../../../syllabus#general-rubric">this rubric</a>.</p><hr /><h2 id="schedule"> <a href="#schedule" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="schedule"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Schedule</h2><h3 id="description-1"> <a href="#description-1" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="description-1"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Description</h3><p>You’ll need to create a detailed plan of <em>what</em> you will do each week in order to execute your proposal and complete your Quarter 2 Project. Your proposed schedule should include:</p><ul><li>A <strong>6 week</strong> schedule with tasks and goals to be accomplished each week.<li>A delineation of responsibilities among group members in the 6 week schedule.</ul><p>By writing your schedule now, it’ll make it clear to both your group and your mentor whether your project can be realistically completed in the given timeframe. When creating your schedule, use your domain’s schedule and pace in Quarter 1 as a guide. What did you do each week? How much were you able to accomplish each week?</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li>Your schedules won’t be set in stone, as you will encounter hiccups along the way. However, by having a “contract” of who is going to do what, when, you’ll be able to hold everyone in your group accountable and will be able to help them if and when they get stuck.<li>The amount of work you plan to do should scale with the size of your group. Groups of 4 should expect to accomplish more than a group of 2. It will be clear from your schedule whether your plan is too ambitious or not ambitious enough.<li>DSC 180B – the capstone course you’ll be enrolled in next quarter – is a 4-unit course, meaning that you should expect to spend 12 hours per week on it on average. Plan for 11 of those hours should be spent on your project. Quality work takes time!</ul><h3 id="frequently-asked-questions"> <a href="#frequently-asked-questions" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="frequently-asked-questions"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>Why a 6 week schedule in a 10 week quarter?</strong></p><p>As mentioned above, not everything will go according to plan and you will face setbacks. By planning to take 6 weeks instead of 10, you’ll have some breathing room to deal with these setbacks.</p><ul><li>Once you complete your tasks, you’ll need to spend a <em>lot</em> of time polishing your work and making it presentable to a broad audience. Remember, you want to build something you’ll look back on in years from now and be proud of, not something you just threw together at the last minute.<li>In the rare case that you finish everything you wanted to before the deadline, you’ll surely be able to pose new questions and add more tasks.</ul><p><strong>How specific should the tasks be?</strong></p><p>As specific as possible.</p><ul><li>Others in your group (and your mentor) should be able to tell exactly what you’re working on by reading a task description in your proposal.<li>The more specific the description, the better. One rule of thumb is that you should never have the same task listed across multiple weeks – if you do, the task is not specific enough! Don’t just say “EDA.”</ul><p><strong>How should we divide tasks up among group members?</strong></p><p>Divide tasks so that they take advantage of the strengths of your group members and so that they can be parallelized.</p><ul><li>Don’t divide tasks so far that you have no idea what your partners are working on and are unable to help them!<li>More details to come in the next Methodology Lesson.</ul><h3 id="deliverables-and-grading-1"> <a href="#deliverables-and-grading-1" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="deliverables-and-grading-1"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Deliverables and Grading</h3><p>You’ll submit your schedule as a PDF to Gradescope <strong>as a group</strong>. It will be separate from your written proposal PDF submission. Your mentor will grade it according to <a href="../../../syllabus#general-rubric">this rubric</a>.</p><hr /><h2 id="elevator-pitch"> <a href="#elevator-pitch" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="elevator-pitch"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Elevator Pitch</h2><h3 id="description-2"> <a href="#description-2" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="description-2"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Description</h3><p>Finally, you’ll need to write and present an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">elevator pitch</a> for your proposal. Your elevator pitch must be <strong>between 1 and 3 minutes</strong> long and should summarize the written proposal and its relevance for an audience that is not familiar with your domain. For instance, suppose you have a job interview in April and someone says “Hey, I saw you did a capstone project. Tell me about it!” You’d give them your elevator pitch.</p><p>Elevator pitches are <strong>purely verbal</strong> – that is, they should not have any accompanying graphics. They should include few implementation details, and instead focus on the problem statement, context, and motivation.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/climb/pdfs-powerpoints/resources-oral/Intro%20to%20sci%20presentations%202010.pdf">typical anatomy</a> of a short presentation is as follows:</p><ul><li>Context: What’s the background? Explain why this area is interesting.<li>Complication: Tell us what solutions currently exist to the problem at hand, and where the “gaps” in current solutions are.<li>Question: Clearly state the question that addresses the problem.<li>Hypothesis: State your proposed solution. Propose a clear, quantifiable hypothesis that will advance our understanding.</ul><p class="note">Unlike the other components of the proposal, pitches will be delivered individually!</p><h3 id="tips"> <a href="#tips" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="tips"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Tips</h3><p>Even though elevator pitches <strong>do not contain slides</strong>, it’s a good idea to use slides to help organize and prepare your pitch. Here’s one approach:</p><ul><li>Create 4-5 slides, each corresponding to a single idea (perhaps one slide for each of the four pieces above).<li>Each slide should contain a title that is a statement of an idea, and a single drawing or explanation.<li><strong>Practice, practice, practice</strong>. When practicing:<ul><li>Talk through the ideas that each slide represent as if you’re explaining them to a listener.<li>Each time you practice, try to vary the way you explain each idea.<li>Over time, your reliance on the slides will decrease. However, <strong>do not</strong> write a script and memorize it; that’s not engaging.<li>Practice giving the pitch to members of your group. Let them interrupt you with questions. Can you adapt your pitch into a conversation if people ask you questions in the middle? If so, you have a strong pitch.<li>Stand up, speak slowly, and enunciate!</ul></ul><h3 id="deliverables-and-grading-2"> <a href="#deliverables-and-grading-2" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="deliverables-and-grading-2"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Deliverables and Grading</h3><p>You’ll submit an <strong>individually</strong> recorded video of you presenting your elevator pitch to YouTube and submit a link to it on Gradescope. There should be no slides in the video, just your face talking. (Let Suraj know if you have any concerns with this requirement.)</p><p>Note that every member of your group will have to record separate videos, even if you write your pitches together and they are largely similar.</p><p class="note">We’ve removed the previous Week 10 “dry run” component of the pitch submission. However, you’re still encouraged to attend office hours in Week 10 to get feedback on your pitches.</p><p>Unlike the written proposal and schedule, your elevator pitch will be graded by methodology TAs. Each of the six bullet points below are worth 1 point.</p><ul><li>Between 1 and 3 minutes long and clear, and is not too rushed or too basic (style)<li>Not overly scripted, though reading off of notes <em>a little</em> is fine (style)<li>Introduces the problem area to a general audience (setup)<li>Explains why the area is interesting to a general audience (setup)<li>Describes the specific problem being approached (approach)<li>Describes how the problem will be approached and how to measure success (approach)</ul><p>To assign a grade to your elevator pitch, we’ll use the following scheme:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Letter Grade<th>Points<tbody><tr><td>A<td>5 - 6<tr><td>B<td>3 - 4<tr><td>C<td>1 - 2<tr><td>F<td>0</table></div></div></div><div class="search-overlay"></div></div>
