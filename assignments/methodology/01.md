Make sure to also complete the [Welcome Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZpdbeqKjmeAlUo5wQJLC2XF2E7xVbIrIHJjt4-lvmuP8F6g/viewform) and submit it with Methodology Assignment 1!

Follow the steps below.

1. On GitHub, create a **private** repository called `DSC180A-Methodology-1`.
2. Using SSH, log into a jumpbox server on DSMLP. **Don't run a launch script just yet** â€“ only do that in step 6.
3. While on the jumpbox server, clone the Git repository you created. Then, change directories into repository (`cd DSC180A-Methodology-1`).
4. Run the command `uname -a > uname-jumpbox.txt`. This saves a snapshot of your server information to a file named `uname-jumpbox.txt`.
5. Run `echo ~ > homedir.txt`. This stores the path to your home directory in a file named `homedir.txt`. At this point, the `DSC180A-Methodology-1` folder should have 2 files in it â€“ `uname-jumpbox.txt` and `homedir.txt`.
6. Use a launch script, like `launch-scipy-ml.sh`, to initialize a container. This will bring you to your home directory once again.
7. Change directories back into your repository again (`cd DSC180A-Methodology-1`). Now, run `uname -a > uname-container.txt`.
8. Open a Jupyter Notebook using the URL that appeared when you ran the launch script, either through port forwarding or the campus VPN.
9. Copy the exact URL that appeared when you ran the launch script. Suppose that URL was `XXX`. Run the command `echo XXX > notebook-url.txt`. This will create a file named `notebook-url.txt` with your notebook's URL in it. To verify that this worked correctly, run `cat notebook-url.txt` and you should see your URL.
10. Commit and push your changes to GitHub. Your repository should have 4 files in it â€“ `uname-jumpbox.txt`, `homedir.txt`, `uname-container.txt`, and `notebook-url.txt`.
11. Submit the GitHub repository to Gradescope under Methodology Assignment 1.
