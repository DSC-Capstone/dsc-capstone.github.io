# ðŸ›  Methodology Assignment 3

Before attempting this assignment, make sure to read [Lesson 4](../../../../lessons/q1/04) and complete the tasks marked **Action Item**{: .label .label-red } there. Submit this assignment to Gradescope by **Sunday, October 23rd at 11:59PM**. Post questions with the assignment [here](https://edstem.org/us/courses/28947/discussion/1970469).

In this assignment, you'll:
1. Create a Dockerfile with required specifications, building off of the [base data science image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ucsdets/datahub-base-notebook) maintained by UCSD ETS.
2. Use that Dockerfile to build an image and push it to Docker Hub.

Follow the steps below. Unless otherwise specified, complete all steps on **your personal computer**. If you're unable to do so, see the last bullet point [here](../../../../lessons/q1/04#installing-docker-locally).

Here's a walkthrough video of the assignment, recorded during the lecture help session on Monday, October 17th at 4PM:

1. Create a folder, and within it create a file with no extensions named `Dockerfile`. In it, copy the [Dockerfile template](https://github.com/ucsd-ets/datahub-example-notebook/blob/master/Dockerfile) from the tutorial from lecture.

2. Modify the Dockerfile so that:
- [`aria2`](https://aria2.github.io/), [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/), and [`traceroute`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute) are installed using `apt-get`
- [`geopandas`](https://geopandas.org/) and [`babypandas`](https://github.com/babypandas-dev/babypandas) are installed using `conda` or `pip`
  - There is nothing special about these packages; we just need you to install something!
- The last line, `CMD ["/bin/bash"]`, is uncommented

3. Following the steps in the [tutorial](https://github.com/ucsd-ets/datahub-example-notebook#step-211-build) linked in lecture, use the Dockerfile you created in Step 2 to create an image (using `docker build`) and launch a container with that image (using `docker run`). Make sure that all packages are present. 
- **Note:** It may take >10 minutes to create the image for the first time. This is to be expected, because it's pulling ~5GB of files. Subsequent pulls will be much faster.
- If you aren't able to build due to an error with the line `RUN apt-get -y install aria2 nmap traceroute`, add `RUN apt update` to your Dockerfile before the aforementioned line.
- To verify that packages you installed via `apt-get` are installed, run `which <package-name>`, e.g. `which nmap` (for `aria2`, use `which aria2c`).
- To verify that packages you installed via `conda` or `pip` are installed, open a Python interpreter and try to import them.

4. Push the image to Docker Hub, again using the instructions in the tutorial from above. **Make sure your repository is public, so that we can verify it was set up correctly!**
- **Note:** It may take up to 30 minutes for your image to appear on Docker Hub after you run `docker push <image>`. This is to be expected.

5. After your image appears on Docker Hub, follow the instructions [from lecture](../../../../lessons/q1/04#using-images-from-docker-hub) to launch a container on DSMLP using your image. Test out your environment on DSMLP. Can you start `python` and import `babypandas`?

6. Submit your assignment to Gradescope by turning in the path to your image on Docker Hub (e.g. `sjrampure/test-image:latest`) and your Dockerfile. Make sure to include the tag (i.e. `:latest`). We will pull your image and test whether it meets the requirements stated above. You will _not_ see an autograder score right away, unlike in Methodology Assignments 1 and 2.
