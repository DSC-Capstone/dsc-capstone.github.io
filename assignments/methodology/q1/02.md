# ðŸ›  Methodology Assignment 2

Before attempting this assignment, make sure to read [Lesson 2](../../../../lessons/q1/02). Submit this assignment to Gradescope by **Sunday, October 9th at 11:59PM**. Post questions with the assignment [here](https://edstem.org/us/courses/28947/discussion/1876813).

Your job for this assignment is to create the project structure for your Quarter 1 Project. Do this **individually**.

* Create a private GitHub repository with the directories and files
  mentioned in the lesson: `src/`, `notebooks/`, `config/`, `references/`,
  `run.py`, `.gitignore`, and `README.md`. (It doesn't matter what you name your repository, but if you want a name, use `DSC180A-Methodology-2`.)
* Create "stub files" in the directories as placeholders as
  well. Stub files can be empty, but should have the correct
  extensions. For example, if a directory will inevitably have Python
  source code, place an empty file in the directory called `stub.py`. (Note that empty directories won't appear on GitHub, so you'll need to place a stub file in every directory you create.)
* Your `.gitignore` file should have appropriate content.

You may find [this
repository](https://github.com/DSC-Capstone/project-templates) useful,
as an example.

Note that like in Methodology Assignment 1, there are no hidden tests on the Gradescope autograder â€“ if you see a 10/10, you'll receive a full score for this assignment.
