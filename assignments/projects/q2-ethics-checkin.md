# Quarter 2 Ethics Check-In with David Danks
{:.no_toc}

In Week 5 or 6 – that is, between **Tuesday, February 6th and Friday, February 16th** – you are **required** to meet with Professor David Danks **in-person** for 15 minutes.

The purpose of the check-in is to have you reflect on how the lesson on [Ethics and Values](../../../lessons/05) from Quarter 1 apply to your project. In the check-in, all members in your group should be prepared to answer the following questions:
* What question(s) are you trying to answer in your project?
* Who are the key stakeholders for your project?
* What are the main tradeoffs / conflicts between the interests of different stakeholders?

You will check-in with your project group. When you sign up, include your group number (which was emailed to you by Suraj on January 7th). **Under no circumstance should there be students from different project groups in the same block!**
