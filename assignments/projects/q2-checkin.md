# Week 3 TA Check-In
{:.no_toc}

In Week 3, your entire group is required to meet with your assigned TA. The [Staff](../../../staff) page contains a list of the domains assigned to each TA.

By the time you attend your Week 3 check-in, you'll have been working on your project for over two weeks. The purpose of the check-in is to ensure that you're making progress in the right direction, are not stuck anywhere, and are on track to meet the other checkpoint deadlines.

At your check-in, discuss the following:

1. A short summary of your project.

2. Your current status on the project, and what each group member is currently working on.

3. Any challenges you may be facing and any questions you have regarding organizing your code.

This is different from your weekly domain meeting, in that this is more about making sure that your ideas and code are coming together coherently, rather than about specific implementation details.

Specifically, you must:
1. Go to **[this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OvZdMrcQkygb4DE7VLaYhNytvbJlUzIQ2ty5voWO2I4/edit#gid=0)** to make an appointment with [your TA](../../../staff). Make sure to sign up as a group, not individually. Email your TA if you cannot make any of their open slots. 
2. 24 hours before your scheduled meeting, submit the following to **[this Gradescope assignment](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/479331/assignments/2545327/)**:
    - The URL of your project's GitHub repo. This **must** be public.
    - An abstract of your problem statement, i.e. a revised version of your proposal. You may copy this directly from your proposal submission, but be sure to update it â€“ the idea is to capture what has changed from your original proposal. (We expect things to change!)
    - The tasks you've each completed so far.
    - The tasks you're each currently working on, and any concerns/issues if any.
