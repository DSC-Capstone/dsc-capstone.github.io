# Quarter 1 Week 9/10 TA Check-In
{:.no_toc}

In Week 9 or 10 – specifically, between Thursday, November 30th and Tuesday, December 5th – you are **required** to meet with your assigned TA **in-person** for 30 minutes. You can see your assigned TA on both the [**Enrollment**](https://dsc-capstone.org/enrollment) and [**Staff**](../../../staff) pages.

There are a few goals for the second check-in of the quarter:
1. To have all members of your group present a dry run of their [Elevator Pitch for the Quarter 2 Project Proposal](../q2-proposal#elevator-pitch). **Come prepared!**
1. To have your TA give you feedback on the structure and reproducibility of your Quarter 1 Project code. (Remember, your repo needs a `README.md` that contains detailed instructions on how to run your code with various targets. See [this newly released video](https://youtu.be/iXvBzLtI5Uk?si=Y1zIAjQTk7BRmCsc) for more details.)
1. To give you an opportunity to communicate any concerns with your progress, group members, or mentor, before the Quarter 1 Project and Quarter 2 Project Proposal are both due. (Remember, both are due on Monday, December 11th.)

You will check-in with your project group of 2-4 for 30 minutes (note the longer slot time relative to the Week 4 TA Check-In). This means that you'll need to already have your project group chosen before you sign up for a check-in. **Under no circumstance should there be students from different project groups in the same block!** If you can't make any of your TA's slots, send an email to both them and me explaining your circumstances.
