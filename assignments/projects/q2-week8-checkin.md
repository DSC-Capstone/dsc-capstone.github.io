# Week 8 TA Check-In
{:.no_toc}

In Week 8 (between February 27th and March 3rd), your entire group is **required** to meet with your assigned TA for 20 minutes. The [Staff](../../../staff) page contains a list of the domains assigned to each TA.

{: .note }
**To sign up for a check-in, go to to [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ICWQYuZFPYRh-Zx2QNN2WSam4pBEHhTPZ_aNSUfLP0/edit#gid=1688613421)**. Make sure to sign up as a group, and only for your TA!<br>Like the showcase, which is **mandatory** and **in-person only**, your Week 8 check-in with your TA is also **mandatory** and **in-person only**. If one of your group members must meet remotely, you must email both your TA and Suraj in advance of your check-in detailing the situation.

### Presentation

The primary goal of the Week 8 check-in is to gauge your preparedness to talk about your project at the [in-person capstone showcase on March 15th](https://hdsishowcase.com).

Firstly, you must come prepared with the latest version of your poster; it should be further along than the poster checkpoint you submitted on February 19th. Bring a laptop on which you can display your latest version.

In addition, you must come prepared to **talk** about your project. As the [Conversations section of Lesson 4](https://dsc-capstone.github.io/lessons/q2/04/#conversations) states, at the poster session, you must be prepared to have conversations with attendees who come from a range of backgrounds (from DSC 10 students to industry partners and faculty). To gauge your readiness, your TA will repeatedly select a random student in your group and ask them a question, such that the questions build off of one another.
- The first question your TA will ask your group is, "So, what's your project about?" Your response should effectively be a two-minute elevator pitch summarizing your project and its impact. **One group member will be randomly selected to give this elevator pitch; as such, everyone should be prepared to.**
- Then, your TA will repeatedly ask randomly-selected group members to answer followup questions. **Each member in your group will be asked at least one question, and each member in your group must speak.**

To reiterate, all group members are expected to be present in-person, and all are expected to speak. If you do not appear at your check-in and don't schedule a followup, you will lose half of your 10% checkpoint grade.

### Website

In addition to working through your presentation and poster, your TA will also give you feedback on your website, whose checkpoint is due on **February 26th**. You are expected to keep refining your website even after the checkpoint.
